  abstract={We derive improved versions of the relations between supermassive black hole mass ( M BH ) and host-galaxy bulge velocity dispersion (σ) and luminosity ( L ; the M -σ and M - L relations), based on 49 M BH measurements and 19 upper limits. Particular attention is paid to recovery of the intrinsic scatter ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] {epsilon} 0 ) in both relations. We find log( M BH / M ☉ ) = α + βlog(σ/200 km s –1 ) with (α, β, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] {epsilon} 0 ) = (8.12 ± 0.08, 4.24 ± 0.41, 0.44 ± 0.06) for all galaxies and (α, β, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] {epsilon} 0 ) = (8.23 ± 0.08, 3.96 ± 0.42, 0.31 ± 0.06) for ellipticals. The results for ellipticals are consistent with previous studies, but the intrinsic scatter recovered for spirals is significantly larger. The scatter inferred reinforces the need for its consideration when calculating local black hole mass function based on the M -σ relation, and further implies that there may be substantial selection bias in studies of the evolution of the M -σ relation. We estimate the M - L relationship as log( M BH / M ☉ ) = α + βlog( L V /10 11 L ☉, V ) of (α, β, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] {epsilon} 0 ) = (8.95 ± 0.11, 1.11 ± 0.18, 0.38 ± 0.09); using only early-type galaxies. These results appear to be insensitive to a wide range of assumptions about the measurement errors and the distribution of intrinsic scatter. We show that culling the sample according to the resolution of the black hole's sphere of influence biases the relations to larger mean masses, larger slopes, and incorrect intrinsic residuals.}

  abstract={We use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and visual classifications of morphology from the Galaxy Zoo project to study black hole growth in the nearby universe ( z < 0.05) and to break down the active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxy population by color, stellar mass, and morphology. We find that the black hole growth at luminosities ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/711/1/284/apj327370ieqn1.gif] {$L[\mbox{O\,{\sc iii}}]$} >10 40  erg s –1 in early- and late-type galaxies is fundamentally different. AGN host galaxies as a population have a broad range of stellar masses (10 10 -10 11 M ☉ ), reside in the green valley of the color-mass diagram and their central black holes have median masses around 10 6.5 M ☉ . However, by comparing early- and late-type AGN host galaxies to their non-active counterparts, we find several key differences: in early-type galaxies, it is preferentially the galaxies with the least massive black holes that are growing, while in late-type galaxies, it is preferentially the most massive black holes that are growing. The duty cycle of AGNs in early-type galaxies is strongly peaked in the green valley below the low-mass end (10 10 M ☉ ) of the red sequence at stellar masses where there is a steady supply of blue cloud progenitors. The duty cycle of AGNs in late-type galaxies on the other hand peaks in massive (10 11 M ☉ ) green and red late-types which generally do not have a corresponding blue cloud population of similar mass. At high-Eddington ratios ( L / L Edd >0.1), the only population with a substantial fraction of AGNs are the low-mass green valley early-type galaxies. Finally, the Milky Way likely resides in the "sweet spot" on the color-mass diagram where the AGN duty cycle of late-type galaxies is highest. We discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of the role of AGNs in the evolution of galaxies.}
