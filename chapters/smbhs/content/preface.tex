A note to the reader:  This chapter is, in essence, the paper previously submitted prior to the Qualifier Exam to partially fulfill the requirements for candidacy for doctoral research.  It is presented as an aside, and the subject matter differs somewhat from the rest of this document.  This content serves as an introduction to the original plan for dissertation research, which was to study the evolution of the spin of supermassive black holes as they accrete gas in the infall towards the center of galaxies following major merger events for the purpose of determining recoil kick velocities and retention probabilities.  However, the simulation methods used in this endeavor were found to be ill-suited to follow black hole evolution between simulation snapshots, and the project had to be abandoned.
