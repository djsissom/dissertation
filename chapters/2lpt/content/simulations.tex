\section{Simulations}
\label{sec:simulations}

We use the Nbody tree/SPH code \gadgettwo\ \citep{2005MNRAS.364.1105S} to evolve six dark matter--only cosmological volumes from $z_{start} = 300$ to $z = 6$ in a $\rm \Lambda CDM$ universe.  Each simulation is initialized using WMAP--5 parameters.  For each of the three simulation pairs, we directly compare \lpt\ and \za\ by identically sampling the CMB transfer function and displacing the initial particle positions to the same starting redshift using \lpt\ and \za.  The three sets of simulations differ only by the initial phase sampling random seed.  Each volume contains $512^{3}$ particles in a 10 $h^{-1}$ Mpc box.  For full simulation details, see \citet{2012ApJ...761L...8H}.
